        <p>Hello, all. My name is Shelby Valdes. I am a Colorado transplant, hailing from the most wholesome city in the world: Las Vegas, NV.
          I am 23 years old, and my hobbies include cooking, playing with my pup, playing the piano, hiking when I feel motivated, and dancing the night away. Coding has found its way onto that list over the past couple of months :) </p>
          <p>My friends and family are incredibly important to me. I have two nieces, Ella and Lily, and one nephew, Gabriel. They are my pride and joy and I am definitely the "cool aunty" to them. My two sisters, Lauren and Haille,
            are my best friends despite the couple of states that separate us. Shout out to my parents Vic and Elle for teaching me to work hard and always make what I want in life happen.
            Here in Colorado, I have made my own little family with my boyfriend Jack, our dog Bella, and our cat Psycho. I have always worked in restaurants, and am currently a server here in Boulder at Rueben's Burger Bistro.</p>
