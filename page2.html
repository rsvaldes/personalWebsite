      <p>I am very excited to start at Galvanize, and naturally a bit nervous as this is still fairly new to me. My interest in coding has been sparked over the past couple of years,
      as I've met lots developers and programmers working in downtown Boulder. I hope to get a job working for some sort of peer to peer based start-up
      company upon graudation, but am also intrigued by the idea of freelancing one day. I also would like to eventually delve into back end programming, and maybe one
      day become involved in artifical intelligence and build some awesome robots. But for now, one step at a time; I am pumped to start building awesome websites and can't
      wait to see what I will be able to do at the end of the Immersive.
